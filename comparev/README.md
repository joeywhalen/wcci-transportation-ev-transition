WeCan{Code}IT FT Java Cohort Summer 2021 Final Project

Group Members: Adam Bundschuh, Micaela Diloreto, George Fought, Jorge Herrera, Joey Whalen. and Nana Yirenkyi

This project revolves around the current transition from ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) to EV (Electric Vehicles). The ComparEV web application assists users with that transition. We provide an interactive app that allows a user to provide information about their current vehicle, and returns suggested electric vehicles as well as estimated time for overall cost savings. The app also provides articles and reviews of electric vehicles based on the user input.

This project will be MVC based and will include Java, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
